        <h1>Datasets</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Two datasets were built to support machine learning models. </p>
        <br>
        <p>First data set of 4700 songs was collected form Billboard Hot-100 Chart in years 1990, 2000, 2010,
          and 2019, using Billboard API library 
          <a href = "https://github.com/guoguo12/billboard-charts" target = "blank">[1]</a>. 
          We fetched charts at the beginning of each month, resulting in 12 charts in total per year for 1990, 
          2000, 2010; for year 2019, there were 11. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we searched the song titles on Spotify using a lightweight python library called Spotipy. 
          Each song has a unique track ID on Spotify, the IDs were then used to read in audio features. 
          Given that there were songs not available on Spotify--in other words, without a corresponding ID--
          and songs without corresponding audio features were dropped, there are a total of 4672 songs in the 
          final dataset. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The other data set contained songs published by artists who are on the Spotify Top 100 Artist Charts 
          <a href = "https://rateyourmusic.com/list/NicklasWachter/spotify-top-100-artists-chart-14_may_2019/" target = "blank">[2]</a>. 
          The artists were selected such that they published at least one full album in the past 5 years (2015-2019), 
          then all the songs they published were filtered so that songs which had not been ranked in the Billboard Hot-100 
          Charts in the corresponding time frame were categorized as unpopular. Same method was used to fetch the unpopular 
          songs audio features.

          Some of the audio features provided in Spotify API are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Acousticness: A confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic (0.0 ~ 1.0)</li>
          <li>Dancebility: How suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity (0.0 ~ 1.0)</li>
          <li>Duration(ms)</li>
          <li>Energy: Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity (i.e., death metal scores high, a Bach prelude scores low) (0.0 ~ 1.0) </li>
          <li>Instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals (0.0 ~ 1.0); values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks </li>
          <li>Liveness: Detects wether the song was performed live (0.0 ~ 1.0)</li>
          <li>Loudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB) (-60dB ~ 0dB) </li>
          <li>Speechiness: Detects the presence of spoken words in a track (0.0 ~ 1.0)</li>
            <ul>
              <li> value > 0.66: tracks are probably made entirely of spoken words</li>
              <li> 0.33 < value < 0.66: tracks may contain both music and speech</li>
              <li> value < 0.33: represent music and other non-speech-like tracks</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM)</li>
          <li>Valence: Describe the emotional tendencies: tracks with high valence sound more cheerful, while tracks with low valence sound more negative</li>
        </ul>
